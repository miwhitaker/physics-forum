Physics Forum
Created by: Michael Whitaker

This is a forum where users can post questions and answers to physics problems. It is intended for students in any physics course
as well as anyone else who has a question about a physics or astronomy topic. Anyone can view the questions and answers, but only
logged in users can actually post information. The topics are organized by scale, which means the size of the objects or realm of
applicability of the principles involved.

Quantum scale - things that are very small (cannot be seen with your eyes alone)
Earth scale - things that exist here on earth and we can see or measure
Astrophysics scale - large things like planets, stars or other objects in our galaxy
Universe scale - things that are extremely big like galaxies or larger

These are not strict rules that anyone should stress about. Many questions will fit into multiple categories, such as statistical
mechanics (using quantum principles to descibe largee scale objects like white dwarf stars).
